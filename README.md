# django-x-clone

This project was created to apply my Django knowledge by attempting to replicate X 

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a web application **only** by using the Django framework to create a website where users can create posts, follow other users, and interact with content similar to the X application.

## Planned Features

1. **User Authentication:** Allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

2. **Post Creation:** Enable users to create short messages, similar to tweets.

3. **User Following:** Allow users to follow other users to see their posts in their feed.

4. **Interactions:** Implement features such as likes, retweets, and comments on posts.

5. **Search:** Add a search feature to allow users to find other users or specific posts.
